# NFL Study - Recommended Learning Path

This document defines the prerequisite structure for cards to ensure concepts are learned in the correct order.

## Learning Philosophy

**Foundational â†’ Applied â†’ Advanced**

1. **Beginner**: Learn terminology definitions (what things ARE)
2. **Intermediate**: Learn how to USE those terms in fantasy context
3. **Advanced**: Master advanced strategies that combine multiple concepts

## Prerequisite System

### How It Works

Cards can have two special fields:
- `defines: "concept-id"` - This card defines a concept
- `prerequisites: ["concept-id"]` - This card requires you to master other concepts first

**Example:**
```javascript
// Beginner - Defines the concept
{
  question: "What is target share?",
  answer: "Percentage of team's targets going to a specific receiver",
  defines: "target-share",
  difficulty: "beginner"
}

// Advanced - Uses the concept
{
  question: "Why is 30%+ target share elite for WRs?",
  answer: "Guarantees high volume regardless of TD variance",
  prerequisites: ["target-share"],
  difficulty: "advanced"
}
```

### Mastery Criteria

A prerequisite is "mastered" when:
- FSRS state = Review (graduated from learning)
- Stability > 7 days (you remember it well)

Until prerequisites are mastered, dependent cards won't appear in your study queue.

## Implementation

The prerequisite system automatically:
1. Shows beginner cards first (no dependencies)
2. Tracks when you "master" a concept (FSRS stability > 7 days)
3. Unlocks dependent cards only after prerequisites mastered
4. Displays locked cards with "ðŸ”’ Locked - Learn X first" message

## Benefits

âœ… **No confusion** - Terms are defined before use
âœ… **Natural progression** - Builds on prior knowledge
âœ… **Confidence** - Each card assumes you know prerequisites
âœ… **Efficiency** - No time wasted on cards you can't understand yet
âœ… **Motivation** - See progress as new cards unlock
