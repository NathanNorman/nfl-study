## 🎓 How It Works

### The FSRS Algorithm

FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) is a scientifically-proven algorithm that:

1. **Tracks Memory Strength**: Each card has a "stability" value representing how well you know it
2. **Predicts Forgetting**: Calculates when you're likely to forget information
3. **Optimizes Scheduling**: Shows cards right before you forget for maximum retention
4. **Adapts to You**: Learns your memory patterns and adjusts intervals accordingly

### Rating System

When you review a card, rate your knowledge:

- **Again (1)** 🔴: Didn't know it → Short interval (~10 minutes)
- **Hard (2)** 🟡: Struggled but got it → Moderate interval (~1 day)
- **Good (3)** 🟢: Knew it confidently → Longer interval (~3-7 days)
- **Easy (4)** 🔵: Perfect recall → Much longer interval (~14+ days)

The algorithm uses your ratings to calculate optimal review intervals, maximizing retention while minimizing study time.

### Adding New Features

**Example: Add a new card data file**

```javascript
// src/data/myNewCards.js
export const myNewCards = [
  {
    question: "What is the X concept?",
    answer: "The X concept is...",
    tags: ["strategy", "advanced"],
    difficulty: "advanced"
  },
  // ... more cards
];
```

**Then import in `generateByDifficulty.js`:**

```javascript
import { myNewCards } from './myNewCards';

// Add to appropriate difficulty array
const advancedCards = [
  ...existingCards,
  ...myNewCards
];
```

indexedDB.deleteDatabase('nfl-study');
location.reload();
```

**FSRS scheduling issues:**
- Check console for detailed FSRS logs
- Verify `due` dates in IndexedDB (F12 → Application → IndexedDB → nfl-study → flashcards)

**UI issues:**
- Check Tailwind CSS classes
- Verify component props
- Check React DevTools for state

## 🚢 Deployment

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Creates optimized production build in `dist/`:
- `dist/index.html` - Flashcard mode entry
- `dist/mcq.html` - MCQ mode entry
- `dist/assets/` - Bundled CSS (~26KB) and JS (~247KB)

### Deploy to Static Hosts

The app is fully client-side with no backend required.

**Netlify:**
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

**Vercel:**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

**GitHub Pages:**
```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Deploy (requires gh-pages package)
npm install -g gh-pages
gh-pages -d dist
```

**Cloudflare Pages / Firebase Hosting / AWS S3:**

Simply upload the `dist/` folder to your hosting service.

### Environment Configuration

No environment variables needed - the app is fully self-contained.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Data Flow

```
User Action → Component → Hook → FSRS Util → Storage → IndexedDB
     ↓          ↓         ↓         ↓           ↓          ↓
  Rating    App.jsx   useCards   fsrs.js   storage.js   Browser
```

**Example: Rating a card**

1. User clicks "Good" (rating 3)
2. `App.jsx` calls `handleRate(3)`
3. `handleRate` calls `updateCard(cardId, 3)` from `useCards` hook
4. `updateCard` calls `scheduleCard(card, 3)` from `fsrs.js`
5. `scheduleCard` uses ts-fsrs to calculate next review date
6. Updated card saved to IndexedDB via `storage.saveCard()`
7. Card won't appear in study queue until due date

### State Management

- **Component state**: UI-specific state (modals, current card index)
- **Custom hooks**: Shared state and logic (useCards, useMCQ)
- **IndexedDB**: Persistent data (cards, progress, FSRS metadata)

No global state library (Redux/Zustand) needed - hooks are sufficient.

### FSRS Integration

The app wraps ts-fsrs with app-specific logic:

- `createCard()`: Converts flashcard data → FSRS card format
- `scheduleCard()`: Calculates next review date based on rating
- `isDue()`: Checks if card is due for review
- `getStateString()`: Human-readable card states

FSRS metadata stored per card:
- `due`: Next review date
- `stability`: Memory strength
- `difficulty`: FSRS difficulty (0-10 scale)
- `state`: New/Learning/Review/Relearning
- `reps`: Total review count
- `lapses`: Times forgotten

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Cards not loading (0 total)**
```javascript
// Clear IndexedDB and refresh
indexedDB.deleteDatabase('nfl-study');
location.reload();
```

**Difficulty badges not showing**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify cards have `difficulty` property
- Clear IndexedDB and regenerate

**Answer showing on next card**
- Fixed in current version
- If still occurring, clear browser cache

**FSRS Schedule Insights not visible**
- Ensure you have reviewed at least one card
- Check that cards have valid `due` dates

**MCQ options not shuffling**
- Verify `useMCQ.js` has shuffle logic
- Check console for errors

**Dev server won't start**
```bash
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Build fails**
```bash
# Check Node.js version (requires 16+)
node --version

# Update dependencies
npm update

# Try clean build
rm -rf dist
npm run build
```

### Performance Issues

**Slow initial load:**
- First load generates 380+ cards (takes ~2-3 seconds)
- Subsequent loads are instant (cards cached in IndexedDB)

**Laggy animations:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Disable browser extensions
- Try Chrome/Edge (best performance)

### Data Issues

**Lost progress:**
- IndexedDB data is browser-specific
- Check you're using the same browser/profile
- Data persists across tab closes but not browser profile switches

**Export your data:**
```javascript
// In console (F12):
const cards = await localforage.getItem('flashcards');
console.log(JSON.stringify(cards));
// Copy output and save to file
```
