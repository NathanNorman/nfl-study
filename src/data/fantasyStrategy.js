    category: "Draft Strategy",
    question: "What is the 'Zero RB' draft strategy?",
    answer: "Wait on RB in early rounds, load up on WR/TE. Target RB late or via waiver wire. Theory: RBs get injured more, WRs more consistent. Riskier in 2025 with elite RB class.",
    tags: ["Draft", "Strategy", "Zero-RB"]
  },
  {
    category: "Draft Strategy",
    question: "Should you draft RB or WR first overall in 2025?",
    answer: "Many experts say Ja'Marr Chase WR1 overall, but Saquon Barkley (2000 yards, Super Bowl champ) is safer. Depends on league scoring.",
    tags: ["Draft", "Strategy", "2025", "First-Pick"]
  },
  {
    category: "Draft Strategy",
    question: "What is 'RB Dead Zone' in fantasy drafts?",
    answer: "Rounds 3-7 where RBs have similar projections but widely different outcomes. Better to go WR-heavy and avoid this zone. Still relevant in 2025.",
    tags: ["Draft", "Strategy", "RB"]
  },
  {
    category: "Draft Strategy",
    question: "What does 'PPR' stand for and how does it affect strategy?",
    answer: "Points Per Reception. Makes pass-catching RBs and slot WRs more valuable. Target high-reception players like Saquon Barkley, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Brock Bowers.",
    tags: ["Scoring", "PPR", "Strategy"]
  },
  {
    category: "Draft Strategy",
    question: "When should you draft a QB in 2025 fantasy football?",
    answer: "Elite rushers (Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Jayden Daniels, Jalen Hurts) worth rounds 2-4. Otherwise wait until round 8+. QB depth is strong in 2025.",
    tags: ["Draft", "QB", "Strategy", "2025"]
  },
  {
    category: "Draft Strategy",
    question: "When should you draft a TE in 2025 fantasy football?",
    answer: "Elite tier (LaPorta, Bowers, McBride) worth rounds 3-5. Kelce declining. Or wait until round 10+. Avoid TE wasteland in middle rounds.",
    tags: ["Draft", "TE", "Strategy", "2025"]
  },
  {
    category: "Draft Strategy",
    question: "What is 'draft capital' and why does it matter for rookies?",
    answer: "Where a player was drafted in NFL Draft. First-round picks get more opportunities. High draft capital = more job security. Example: Jayden Daniels #2 overall became OROY.",
    tags: ["Draft", "Rookies", "NFL-Draft"]
  },
  {
    category: "Draft Strategy",
    question: "What is ADP and why is it important?",
    answer: "Average Draft Position. Shows where players are typically drafted. Use to find value - players performing above/below their ADP. Updated daily during draft season.",
    tags: ["Draft", "ADP", "Value"]
  },

  // Scoring Systems
  {
    category: "Scoring",
    question: "What is the difference between PPR and Standard scoring?",
    answer: "PPR awards 1 point per reception. Standard gives 0. Half-PPR gives 0.5. PPR makes pass-catching RBs like Saquon and slot WRs like Amon-Ra more valuable.",
    tags: ["Scoring", "PPR", "Formats"]
  },
  {
    category: "Scoring",
    question: "How are QB points typically scored in fantasy?",
    answer: "4 points per passing TD (sometimes 6), 1 point per 25 passing yards, 6 points per rushing TD, 1 point per 10 rushing yards. This makes Josh Allen/Lamar elite.",
    tags: ["Scoring", "QB"]
  },
  {
    category: "Scoring",
    question: "What is a 'boom/bust' player in fantasy?",
    answer: "Player with high variance. Some weeks huge points, others very low. Example: DK Metcalf, Tyreek Hill. Opposite is 'high floor' player like CeeDee Lamb.",
    tags: ["Strategy", "Player-Types"]
  },

  // 2025 Specific Strategy
  {
    category: "2025 Strategy",
    question: "Why is Ja'Marr Chase the #1 pick in many 2025 drafts?",
    answer: "Triple Crown winner 2024. Elite QB connection with Joe Burrow. WR more consistent than RB. But Saquon Barkley is safer with 2000-yard season.",
    tags: ["Draft", "2025", "First-Pick"]
  },
  {
    category: "2025 Strategy",
    question: "Should you fade Travis Kelce in 2025 drafts?",
    answer: "Age 36 in 2025. Showed decline 2024. Still TE1 but don't reach. Wait for better value at TE like McBride, LaPorta, Bowers.",
    tags: ["Draft", "TE", "2025", "Fade"]
  },
  {
    category: "2025 Strategy",
    question: "Is Jayden Daniels a top-5 QB for 2025 fantasy?",
    answer: "Yes! 2024 OROY. Historic dual-threat stats as rookie. Only gets better in Year 2. Elite QB1 potential.",
    tags: ["QB", "2025", "Breakout"]
  },
  {
    category: "2025 Strategy",
    question: "Should you draft Super Bowl champion Eagles players?",

  {
    category: "Waiver Wire",
    question: "When should you spend big FAAB dollars?",
    answer: "On league-winners: Bellcow RBs who get lead role due to injury, breakout WRs in good offenses. Don't save for playoffs - championships won early.",
    tags: ["Waiver-Wire", "FAAB", "Strategy"]
  },
  {
    category: "Waiver Wire",
    question: "What is a 'handcuff' in fantasy football?",

    tags: ["Waiver-Wire", "Handcuff", "RB"]
  },
  {
    category: "Waiver Wire",
    question: "What is 'streaming' in fantasy football?",

  },

  // In-Season Management
  {
    category: "Strategy",
    question: "What does 'start your studs' mean?",

    tags: ["Strategy", "Lineup"]
  },
  {
    category: "Strategy",
    question: "When should you trade away a player?",
    answer: "Sell high after big games, before decline. Trade injured players before extended absence. Target playoff schedule trades mid-season (weeks 8-10).",

  },
  {
    category: "Strategy",
    question: "What is 'target share' and why does it matter?",
    answer: "Percentage of team's targets a player gets. 25%+ is elite. High target share = consistent fantasy production. More important than TDs. CeeDee Lamb elite target share.",
    tags: ["Stats", "Target-Share", "WR"]
  },
  {
    category: "Strategy",
    question: "What is the '3-down back' or 'bellcow' in fantasy?",

    tags: ["RB", "Snap-Share", "Bellcow"]
  },
  {
    category: "Strategy",
    question: "What does 'snap count' tell you about a player?",
    answer: "Percentage of offensive plays player is on field. 70%+ is workhorse. Under 50% is concerning. Tracks opportunity and role. Check weekly snap counts.",
    tags: ["Stats", "Snap-Count"]
  },
  {
    category: "Strategy",
    question: "What is 'red zone usage' and why does it matter?",
    answer: "How often player is targeted/given ball inside opponent's 20-yard line. Red zone touches = TD opportunities. Huge for fantasy. Example: Mike Evans red zone king.",

  },
  {
    category: "Advanced Stats",
    question: "What is 'air yards' for wide receivers?",

    tags: ["Stats", "Air-Yards", "WR"]
  },
  {
    category: "Advanced Stats",
    question: "What is 'opportunity share' for running backs?",
    answer: "Percentage of team's RB touches (carries + targets). 70%+ is bellcow territory. Predicts fantasy volume. Saquon had 75%+ in Philly 2024.",

  {
    category: "Advanced Stats",
    question: "What is 'snap share' and why does it matter?",

    tags: ["Stats", "Snaps"]
  },

  // Team Context
  {
    category: "Team Context",
    question: "Why do offensive line rankings matter for RBs?",
    answer: "Better O-lines create bigger holes and more rushing yards. 2025 elite O-lines: Eagles, 49ers, Lions, Ravens. Helps RB fantasy value tremendously.",
    tags: ["O-Line", "RB", "Context"]
  },
  {
    category: "Team Context",
    question: "What is 'positive game script' in fantasy?",
    answer: "When team is winning, they run more (good for RBs). Losing teams pass more (good for WRs/QBs). Script affects usage. Eagles/Ravens run-heavy when winning.",

  },
  {
    category: "Team Context",
    question: "Why does a RB's receiving ability matter?",
    answer: "Pass-catching RBs stay on field in all game scripts (winning or losing). More snaps = more opportunity. Crucial in PPR. Example: Saquon caught 67 passes in 2024.",

  // Playoff Strategy
  {
    category: "Playoffs",

  },
  {
    category: "Playoffs",
    question: "Should you trade for playoff-bound players vs eliminated teams?",

  },

  // Common Mistakes
  {
    category: "Mistakes",
    question: "What is 'chasing points' in fantasy football?",
    answer: "Starting player who had big week, expecting repeat. Don't overreact to one game. Look at usage trends (snaps, targets, touches), not just points.",
    tags: ["Mistakes", "Psychology"]
  },
  {
    category: "Mistakes",
    question: "Why shouldn't you draft a team's handcuff too early?",
    answer: "Backup RBs are only valuable if starter gets hurt (low probability). Don't draft handcuff in middle rounds. Wait for late rounds (12+) or waiver wire.",
    tags: ["Draft", "Handcuff", "Mistakes"]
  },
  {
    category: "Mistakes",
    question: "What is 'sunk cost fallacy' in fantasy trades?",
    answer: "Holding onto player because of where you drafted them, even if underperforming. First-round busts happen. Move on quickly. Trade them while they have name value.",
    tags: ["Trading", "Psychology", "Mistakes"]
  },
  {
    category: "Mistakes",
    question: "Should you avoid players on bad NFL teams?",
    answer: "No! Bad teams throw more when losing (good for WRs/QBs). Giants (Malik Nabers), Browns, Panthers still have fantasy relevant players.",
