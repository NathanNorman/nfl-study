    tags: ["MY-ROSTER", "RB", "James-Cook", "BUF"]
  },
  {
    question: "Why is James Cook valuable in fantasy?",
    answer: "Lead back in elite Bills offense. Gets goal-line work. Josh Allen spreads ball around. 18-22 touches = RB1 volume.",

  },
  {
    question: "What's the risk with Justin Jefferson on your roster?",
    answer: "Injury history (2023 hamstring). QB play with Sam Darnold. Bye Week 6. But talent is undeniable - when healthy, he's top-5 WR.",

  },
  {
    question: "What's Cooper Kupp's (YOUR WR2) outlook for 2024?",

    tags: ["MY-ROSTER", "WR", "Cooper-Kupp", "LAR"]
  },
  {
    question: "Should you be concerned about Cooper Kupp?",
    answer: "Age 31, injury history. BUT: Still Stafford's favorite target. Slot role = PPR value. Monitor health weekly.",

  },
  {
    question: "Should you trust Woody Marks in your lineup?",

    tags: ["MY-ROSTER", "BENCH", "DK-Metcalf", "SEA"]
  },
  {
    question: "When should you start DK Metcalf over your current WRs?",
    answer: "vs weak secondaries. When Kupp is injured. If Jefferson is out. Otherwise bench for consistency of Jefferson/Kupp.",

  },
  {
    question: "Is Rhamondre Stevenson worth keeping on your bench?",
    answer: "Lead back role = value. Patriots offense struggles. Hold as RB depth. Trade bait if someone needs RB.",

    tags: ["MY-ROSTER", "BENCH", "Calvin-Ridley", "TEN"]
  },
  {
    question: "Should you drop Calvin Ridley from your roster?",
    answer: "WR1 for Titans = targets. QB play is bad. Hold as WR depth. Could have spike weeks. Trade if possible.",
    tags: ["MY-ROSTER", "BENCH", "Calvin-Ridley", "Strategy"]
  },
  {
    question: "Why is DeAndre Hopkins (BENCH) on your bench?",
    answer: "Baltimore Ravens WR4. Only 2 targets per game. Too crowded - Zay Flowers, Mark Andrews. Droppable for better upside.",
    tags: ["MY-ROSTER", "BENCH", "DeAndre-Hopkins", "BAL"]
  },
  {
    question: "Should you drop DeAndre Hopkins for waiver wire pickup?",
    answer: "YES - only 2 targets/game as WR4. Ravens run-heavy. Better options on waivers. Drop for RB handcuff or upside WR.",
    tags: ["MY-ROSTER", "BENCH", "DeAndre-Hopkins", "Waiver-Wire"]
  },

  // Kicker & Defense
  {
    question: "Why is Harrison Butker (YOUR K) elite?",

  },
  {
    question: "What's your roster's biggest strength?",
    answer: "Elite RB depth: Cook, Kyren, Javonte, Woody. Can flex RBs weekly. Strong RB core wins leagues.",
    tags: ["MY-ROSTER", "Strategy", "Strengths"]
  },
  {
    question: "What's your roster's biggest weakness?",
    answer: "WR depth after Jefferson/Kupp. Bench WRs (DK, Ridley, Hopkins) unreliable. Consider trading RB depth for WR upgrade.",
    tags: ["MY-ROSTER", "Strategy", "Weaknesses"]
  },
  {
    question: "Who on your roster has the highest trade value?",
    answer: "James Cook (RB1 in elite offense) or Justin Jefferson (elite WR when healthy). Could fetch WR1 + RB2 package.",
    tags: ["MY-ROSTER", "Strategy", "Trading"]
  },
  {
    question: "What waiver wire position should you target?",
    answer: "WR depth! Drop Hopkins, target high-upside WRs. Your RB room is solid. Need WR insurance for Jefferson/Kupp bye/injury.",
